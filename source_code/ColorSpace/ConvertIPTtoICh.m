function imgOut = ConvertIPTtoICh(img, inverse)
%
%       imgOut = ConvertIPTtoICh(img, inverse)
%
%
%        Input:
%           -img: image to convert from IPT to ICh or from ICh to IPT.
%           -inverse: takes as values 0 or 1. If it is set to 0 the
%                     transformation from IPT to ICh is applied, otherwise
%                     the transformation from IChto IPT.
%
%        Output:
%           -imgOut: converted image in IPT or ICh (see inverse).
